I will be building a simple calculator in my path to learning python through project series.
# This is my day two on that series: i have currently learnt about:
1.How to comment in python using "#"
2.Standard input and output in python, input() and print()
3. Variables in python
4. data types in python

My focus is not creating an actual application but rather gaining knowledge on concepts in python i might come back and improve some functionality later on when am experienced enough:)
Am also trying to understand how python can be of us to our daily arithmetic operations.
